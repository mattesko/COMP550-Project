It was a cowboy'\u0080\u0099s life, a gamblers life, a life for someone who wanted no boss, constant movement, and the thrill of a dice roll every time a new passenger got into the cab.\n\nWhat I didn't count on when I took the job was that it was also a ministry. Because I drove the night shift, the car became a rolling confessional. Passengers would climb in, sit behind me in total darkness and anonymity, and tell me of their lives. \n\nWe were like strangers on a train, the passengers and I, hurtling through the night, revealing intimacies we would never have dreamed of sharing during the brighter light of day.\n\nIn those hours, I encountered people whose lives amazed me, ennobled me, made me laugh, and made me weep.  And none of those lives touched me more than that of a woman I picked up late on a warm August night. I was responding to a call from a small brick fourplex in a quiet part of town. I assumed I was being sent to pick up some partyers, or someone who had just had a fight with a lover or someone going off to an early shift at some factory in the industrial part of town.\n\nWhen I arrived at the address, the building was dark except for a single light in a ground-floor window. Under these circumstances many drivers would just honk once or twice, wait a short minute, and then drive away. Too many bad possibilities awaited a driver who went up to a darkened building at two-thirty in the morning.\n\nBut I had seen too many people trapped in a live of poverty who depended on the cab as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door to try to find the passenger. It might, I reasoned, be someone who needed my assistance. Would I not want a driver to do the same if my mother or father had called for a cab? \n\nSo I walked to the door and knocked.\n\n\"Just a minute\", answered a frail and elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor. \n\nAfter a long pause, the door opened. A small woman, somewhere in her eighties, stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like you might see in a costume shop or a Goodwill store or in a 1940s movie. By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The sound had been her dragging it across the floor.\n\nThe apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.\n\n\"Would you carry my bag out to the car?\" she said. \"I'd like a few moments alone. Then, if you could come back and help me? I'm not very strong.\"\n\nI took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman. She took my arm, and we walked slowly toward the curb. She kept thanking me for my kindness. \n\n\"It's nothing\", I told her. \"I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated\". \n\n\"Oh, you're such a good boy\", she said. Her praise and appreciation were almost embarrassing.\n\nWhen we got in the cab, she gave me an address, and then asked, \"Could you drive through downtown?\"\n\n\"It's not the shortest way,\" I answered. \n\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" she said. \"I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice\".\n\nI looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. \n\n\"I don't have any family left,\" she continued. \"The doctor said I should go there. He says I don't have very long.\" \n\nI quietly reached over and shut off the meter. \"What route would you like me to go?\" I asked.\n\nFor the next two hours we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they had first been married. She made me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl. Sometimes she would have me slow down in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.\n\nAs the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, \"I'm tired. Let's go now.\"\n\nWe drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a tar driveway that passed under a portico. Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. Without waiting for me, they opened the door and began assisting the woman. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her: perhaps she had phone them right before we left.\n\nI opened the trunk and took the small suitcase up to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair. \n\n\"How much do I owe you?\" she asked, reaching into her purse. \n\n\"Nothing,\" I said.\n\n\"You have to make a living,\" she answered. \n\n\"There are other passengers,\" I responded. \n\nAlmost without thinking, I bent over and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly. \"You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,\" she said. \"Thank you.\" \n\nThere was nothing more to say. I squeezed her hand once, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me I could hear the door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life.\n\nI did not pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought. For the remainder of that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten a driver who had been angry or abusive or impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run or had honked once, then driven away? What if I had been in a foul mood and had refused to engage the woman in conversation? How many other moments like that had I missed or failed to grasp?\n\nWe are so conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments. But great moments often catch us unawares. When that woman hugged me and said that I had brought her a moment of joy, it was possible to believe  that I had been placed on earth for the sole purpose of providing her with that last ride. I do not think that I have done anything in my life that was any more important. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, January 2012","13509":"Ivanka Trump, by way of a female entrepreneurship fund, received a $100 million donation from Saudi Arabia.","4411":" \u201cWe\u2019re now exporting energy for the first time.

I AM SO MAD! \n\nWhat does this word mean? Dhimmitude\n\nThe word \"Dhimmitude\" is found in the new health care bill. So what does it mean? Obama used it in the health care bill . Now isn't this interesting? It is also included in the health care law.\n\nDhimmitude. I had never heard the word until now, so I typed it into Google and started reading. Pretty interesting! It's on Page 107 of the Obama healthcare bill. I looked this up on Google and, yep, it exists.....it is a REAL word.\n\nDhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslin populations conquered through jihad (Holy War). Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presenceAND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam!\n\nObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States!\n\nMuslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured! Islam considers insurance to be \"gambling,\" \"risk-taking,\" and \"usury\" and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this.\n\nHow convenient. So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de-facto government insurance. \n\nNon-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude.\n\nAmerican citizens need to know about it...... Every non-Muslim in the United States of America needs to know about it. \n\n\n\nObamaCare discriminates against Christians and Jews by denying them special exemptions extended to other religions.\n\nIf you are a mainstream Christian or a Jew, you need not apply to Opt Out of ObamaCare; that exemption is reserved for Muslims, Scientologists, Amish, Christian Scientists and Native American Indians who have a \"conscientious objection\" to insurance. A conscientious objection to theft committed by rouge politicians under the color of law with the threat of violence for non-compliance isn\u2019t sufficient in America today to exempt average Americans from the stranglehold of government.

Ludwig lived most of his adult life in Connecticut. His SSN begins with the digits 042, which are among those reserved for Connecticut residents. Obama never lived or worked in that state, so there is no reason for his SSN to start with the digits 042.\n\nNow comes the best part. Ludwig spent the final months of his life in Hawaii, where he died. Conveniently, Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Payne Dunham, worked part-time in the Probate Office in the Honolulu Hawaii Courthouse, and therefore had access to the SSNs of deceased individuals. The Social Security Administration was never informed of Ludwig's death, and because he never received Social Security benefits there were no benefits to stop and no questions were raised. The suspicion, of course, is that Dunham, knowing her grandson was not a  U.S. citizen \u2014 either because he was born in  Kenya or became a citizen of  Indonesia upon his adoption by Lolo Soetoro \u2014 merely scoured the probate records until she found someone who died who was not receiving Social Security benefits, and \"selected\" that SSN for Obama.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, June 2011","15065":"Boiling the same water twice will make your water dangerous to drink.","10193":"\u201cWe\u2019ve made tremendous strides in the Middle East.

This chip will not only contain your personal information with tracking capability but it will also be linked to your bank account. And get this, Page 1004 of the new law (dictating the timing of this chip), reads, and I quote: \"Not later than 36 months after the date of the enactment\". It is now the law of the land that by March 23rd 2013 we will all be required to have an RFID chip underneath our skin and this chip will be link to our bank accounts as well as have our personal records and tracking capability built into it...\"\n\n\n\nSeems people will be getting more than they bargained for in this new health care bill.\n\nThe Obama health care bill under Sec. 2521, page 1,000 will establish a National Medical Device Registry. What does a National Medical Device Registry mean?\n\nNational Medical Device Registry from H.R. 3200 [Healthcare Bill], pages 1,001-1,008:\n(g)(1) The Secretary shall establish a national medical device registry (in this subsection referred to as the 'registry') to facilitate analysis of postmarket safety and outcomes data on each device that:\n\n(A) is or has been used in or on a patient;\n(B) and is:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 (i) a class III device;\n\n\u00a0 &nbsp or (ii) a class II device that is implantable, life-supporting, or life-sustaining.\nA \"class II device that is implantable?\"\n\nThen on page 1,004 it describes what the term \"data\" means in paragraph 1, section B: \"(B) In this paragraph, the term 'data' refers to in formation respecting a device described in paragraph (1), including claims data, patient survey data, standardized analytic files that allow for the pooling and analysis of data from disparate data environments, electronic health records, and any other data deemed appropriate by the Secretary.\"\n\nApproved by the FDA, a class II implantable device is a \"implantable radiofrequency transponder system for patient identification and health information.\"\n\nThis sort of device would be implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option. With the reform of the private insurance companies, who charge outrageous rates, many people will switch their coverage to a more affordable insurance plan. This means the number of people who choose the public option will increase. This also means the number of people chipped will be plentiful as well. The adults who choose to have a chip implanted are the lucky (yes, lucky if you're a Govt Control Libtard) ones in this case. Children who are \"born in the United States who at the time of birth is not otherwise covered under acceptable coverage\" will be qualified and placed into the CHIP or Children's Health Insurance Program (what a convenient name). With a name like CHIP it would seem consistent to have the chip implanted into a child. Children conceived by parents who are already covered under the public option will more than likely be implanted with a chip by the consent of the parent. Eventually everyone will be implanted with a chip. And with the price and coverage of the public option being so competitive with the private companies, the private company may not survive.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via the Internet, March 2010","5165":"\"He (Obama) has done several things well.

It is important to note that this does not reflect the quality of the food being processed or sold \u2013 it only means that the products are approved as being prepared in accordance with the traditions of the Muslim faith.\n\u00a0\nWe are aware of an increasing number of large companies both in Australia and overseas, such as Kraft and Cadbury, who have obtained accreditation to use the Halal logo. We don\u2019t believe they have done this because of any religious commitment but rather for purely commercial reasons. Perhaps these large organisations can afford to do this. While we have a choice however, we would prefer to avoid unnecessarily increasing the cost of our products in order to pay for Halal accreditation when this money would be better spent continuing to support important charitable causes where assistance is greatly needed.\n\nWe point out that we have never been asked to put a Christian symbol (or any other religious symbol) on our food requiring that we send money to a Christian organization for the right to do so.\n\nOthers would add that money paid to ANY Muslim 'organization' (and you had better believe it: these people ARE 'organized') can easily find its way into the hands of Islamic extremist-fanatics and murderers, irrespective of assurances to the contrary.\n\nWhat other assurances do we accept from Muslims?\n\nOh, that's right, 'Islam is a religion of PEACE'!\n\nHow less Australian can companies get, than to place money into the hands of those who seek to exploit us?\"\n\nThis is an example of how the leaders of Muslims in Australia\/NewZealand are bullying large commercial organizations (especially in the food industry) into paying what is no more than blatant extortion money. The amazing part is that these weak-kneed organizations (Cadbury\/ Schweppes\/ Nestles\/ Kraft etc.) actually pay the large sums demanded by these self-appointed religious bureaucrats.\n\nOf course, the manufacturers promptly pass this levy on to unwitting consumers as cost increases. Next time you buy a block of Cadbury's chocolate, look for the Halal Certification seal on the wrapper. So, regardless of your own religious faith, you end up subsidizing Islam.\nThe Council also controls the Muslim voter bloc which, as yet, does not have sufficient critical mass to make a difference - but give them time.\n\nSeveral state jurisdictions are under pressure to adopt or permit Sharia Law in Marriage, Family and Property matters and some, under the delusion that they are being progressively liberal, are permitting this. This has already happened in some local authorities in the U.K. Google the U.K. Education Department's current investigation into the conduct of Muslim-run schools in the Birmingham area of England.\n\nHow many more warnings do people need?\n\nCheck the produce on the shelf and don't buy anything Muslim extorted.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, June 2016","12655":"A photograph shows author J.D.

As her poor little body was being moved, a worn and crumpled purse was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some trash dump.

It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for a 57 cent payment.\n\nChurch members made large subscriptions. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,000.00 \u2014 a huge sum for that time (near the turn of the century). Her unselfish love had paid large dividends.\n\nWhen you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300, and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside at Sunday school time.\n\nIn one of the rooms of this building may be seen the picture of the sweet face of the little girl whose 57 cents, so sacrificially saved, made such remarkable history. Alongside of it is a portrait of her kind pastor, Dr. Russell H. Conwell, author of the book, Acres of  Diamonds \u2014 a true story.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via the Internet, 1999","417":"\"I've always said it's (offshore drilling) up to the states and I still say that.\"","3548":"Says Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, has \"paid to export throughout the world\" Wahhabism -- \"an extreme form of Islam\" that basically teaches \"Americans are the devil.\"","4533":"Says Hillary Clinton \"was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia.\"","7462":"\"When I was in college, we used to take a popcorn popper . . . and we would fry squirrel.\"","9415":"\"The Civil War wasn't about slavery.\"","9950":"\"For decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them.\"","9100":" President Trump \u201csigned an executive order allowing our veterans to get 100% medical bills paid at hospitals other than a V.A. hospital.\u201d ","12573":"Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz \"going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest.\"","4060":"Senator Bernie Sanders said in a speech that cops were to blame for crime.","3174":"\"I've either balanced every budget or we turned back a surplus.\"","3740":"President Eisenhower rejected the idea of military parades, saying they \"would make us look weak.\"","4156":"In the past 20 years, Egypt has made \"great strides\" in political and democratic reform.","8784":"Says Hillary Clinton \"wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now.\"","10853":"\"It is only under President Trump that we have become the largest producer of oil and gas resources.\"","10669":"\"In the current law, if you report harassment, you're the one that has to go into 20 hours of counseling before you can decide whether you were really harassed.\"","761":"Says Mahatma Gandhi once said, \"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\"","5638":"The FDA classified walnuts as drugs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIs it true that the FDA has declared walnuts are a drug because of health claims on packaging?\n\nGotta love the Federal Government.

Fourteen days ago President Obama issued an Executive Order that you should know about.  This order gives an unprecedented level of authority to the President and the federal government to take over all the fundamental parts of our economy - in the name of national security - in times of national emergency. This means all of our water resources, construction services and materials (steel, concrete, etc.), our civil transportation system, food and health resources, our energy supplies including oil and natural gas \u2014 even farm equipment \u2014 can be taken over by the President and his cabinet secretaries. The Government can also draft U.S. citizens into the military and force U.S. citizens to fulfill \"labor requirements\" for the purposes of \"national defense.\" There is not even any Congressional oversight, only briefings are required.\n\nBy issuing this as an Executive Order the President puts the federal government above the law, which, in a democracy, is never supposed to happen.\n\nAs President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, he has the Constitutional authority to issue executive orders.  And while similar orders have been made before by presidents from Eisenhower and Reagan to Clinton and George Bush - it has never been done to this extent.\n\nIt is still unclear why this order was signed now, and what the consequences are for our nation - especially during times of peace.  This type of Martial Law imposes a government takeover on U.S. citizens that is typically reserved for national emergencies, not in a time of relative peace.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, March 2012","6843":"\"Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter.\"","1935":"\"The Earth is 6,000 years old, that\u2019s a fact.\"","9643":"Says New York has \u2018bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp.\u2019","14654":"The stimulus has \"$30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco.\"","1595":"On a visit to the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin in June 2018, First Lady Melania Trump wore a Doctor Who-themed T-shirt bearing the word \"Exterminate.\"","9597":" \"White House \u2018Resistance\u2019 Mole a Fake \u2013 NY Times Admits They Were Trolled.\" ","4773":"\"Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy.\"","13437":" Claimed that only 3 percent of those who were released after being caught illegally crossing the border show up for their immigration hearings.

Then suddenly, no one ever mentioned anything about those Israelis and later it became clear that they remarkably did not show up in their jobs the day the incident took place.\n\nNo one talked about any Israeli being killed or wounded in the attacks. Arab diplomatic sources revealed to the Jordanian al-Watan newspaper that those Israelis remained absent that day based on hints from the Israeli General Security apparatus, the Shabak, the fact which evoked unannounced suspicions on American officials who wanted to know how the Israeli government learned about the incident before it occurred, and the reasons why it refrained from informing the U.S authorities of the information it had.\n\nSuspicions had increased further after Israeli newspaper Yadiot Ahranot revealed that the Shabak prevented Israeli premier Ariel Sharon from traveling to New York and particularly to the city's eastern coast to participate in a festival organized by the Zionist organizations in support of the \"Israel\". Aharon Bernie, the commentator at the newspaper, brought up the issue and came up with a negative conclusion, saying \"no answer\". He then asked about the clue behind the Shabak's position in preventing Sharon's participation, and again without giving an answer.\n\nBernie added that Sharon, who was delighted for having his speech on top of the festival agenda, asked the head of the organization to mediate and convince the Shabak to change its position, but his attempts were in vain. The next day after Sharon's secretary officially announced that Sharon would not participate the incident took place.\n\nFor its part, the Israeli Ha'aretz newspaper revealed that the FBI arrested five Israelis four hours after the attack on the Twin Towers while filming the smoking skyline from the roof of their company's building. The FBI had arrested the five for \"puzzling behavior\". They are said to have been caught videotaping the disaster in what was interpreted as cries of joy and mockery.\n\n\n\nIt has been confirmed by the US Goverment and FBI that at the time of the accident, there were 4000 Jews who MIRACULOUSLY never came to their work an the World trade Center building at the time of the accident. This means the Jews knew and were prewarned about the accident that the WTC was going to be hit.... WHY ??????\n\nIn every crime you look at who has most to benefit from the act. In this case this crime has been a disaster for America, for the world and also for Arabs and Musilms. The only people who benefited from this act of terror are the Jews. This is not the first time Israel and the Jews have done something like this in the name of someone else to further their own selfish needs. They have even resorted to kiling their own people to win public sympathy and support. This act is not beyond the capabilities and evil deeds of Israel. In this case it seems that it is clear to all that the Jews\/Israel have most to gain and should be considered as a possible source behind this act.\n\nI hope the FBI follows the smoking gun as no one will commit an act unless he has something to gain from it, Israel should be a prime suspect in this case.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, September 2001","8057":"Donald Trump and Mike Pence did not steal their campaign logo from a Nevada brothel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, July 2016","11702":"AOL is reducing by $2 per e-mail forward the hospital bill of a little girl badly burned in a fire at a Wal-Mart.","4997":"ABC banned on-air news personnel from wearing American flag pins after 9\/11.","13552":"An image shows two Disney animated characters sharing the studio's first same-sex kiss.","10944":"Due to actions by President Barack Obama, \"the Burger King national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases.\"","281":" As state's attorney, Brendan Kelly had \u201c50% of crimes pled out.\u201d ","11508":"\"Malia Obama just got arrested buying cocaine\"","6381":"North Carolina no longer considers the $20 bill to be legal tender.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI just saw on Facebook, where North Caroline State Legislature has just passed a bill that will ban the $20 bill from status as a legal tender for any public or private debt.

Can you believe the nerve of these people? It's almost funny. The State of Sonora is angry at the influx of Mexicans into Mexico. Nine state legislators from the Mexican State of Sonora traveled to Tucson to complain about Arizona's new employer crackdown on illegals from Mexico.\n\nIt seems that many Mexican illegals are returning to their hometowns and the officials in the Sonora state government are ticked off.\n \nA delegation of nine state legislators from Sonora was in Tucson on Tuesday to state that Arizona's new Employer Sanctions Law will have a devastating effect on the Mexican state.\n\nAt a news conference, the legislators said that Sonora \u2014 Arizona's southern neighbor, made up of mostly small towns \u2014 cannot handle the demand for housing, jobs and schools that it will face as Mexican workers return to their hometowns from the USA without jobs or money.\n\n\nThe Arizona law, which took effect Jan. 1, punishes Arizona employers who knowingly hire individuals without valid legal documents to work in the United States. Penalties include suspension of, or loss of, their business license.\n\nThe Mexican legislators are angry because their own citizens are returning to their hometowns, placing a burden on THEIR state government.

It is a little long but what this mother experienced here in Rochester needs to get out to the public fast so it does not happen to anyone else. Please share.\n\nIm going to share the scariest moment of my life to spread awareness that this is in our community and in our lives.\n\nThis happened on July 4th 2016 Silver Lake Park In Rochester, MN at the fire work show.\n\nMy family and I attended the fire work show with one of my closest friends and her children. We walked along the path next to the graveyard and river to get there and found a spot right next to the stage, immediately my youngest, their dad myself and 2 others went to get some concessions for the show. I left my daughter Amora with my friend and her other 2 kids.\n\nI got a text from her saying \"Amora wants mom and dad\". We returned and the show had already started. Took our seats and watched the show. After the finale a stage lit up and a young man started singing catchy songs- this immediately caught all of our attentions and we were like lets go! Our boyfriends didn't feel the same and wanted to walk home before the crowds started pouring out. We separated and headed to the stage with our total 5 children to join the fun. Our kids were LOVING the show, dancing, singing , jumping with joy so i took out my phone to record the fun. As i was recording i put my phone down because i noticed out of 300+ people there was ONE man who stuck out. He was a 40-50 year old Arab man who was standing completely still, right behind my daughter. He looked blank in every way possible. He noticed that i had noticed him and we locked eyes, i pulled my 4 year old away from him and she was upset that i had taken her view of the stage away so she started dancing again. Then he was right behind her again, but this time he pulled out his phone and took her picture, i launched at him and he started to walk away but as he walked away from me he grabbed Amora's head to see if she would willingly come with him. NO WAY i ran after this man. I screamed for him and he pretended not to hear me, i finally touched him and he turned around. I yelled at him and tried to take his phone he replied \" sorry she is just so beautiful with a disgusting SMIRK on his face, then out of the dark path way two older men ( also middle eastern ) emerged and stood behind him firmly. I screamed at him for touching my daughter and demanded the phone back, i told him i was calling the cops he said \"OO so scary\" in a mocking tone. I then got furious and said their dad was going to beat the crap out of them, he responded with \" he is not here though\" immediately i became panicked they had been watching us, i was thinking there was more of them in the group and turned around to get my babies. After this incident we got the hell out of there. My friend and i took our babies and got home, we then talked about what had happened. I found it SO odd that she texted me \"Amora wants her mom and Dad\" she had sent me that text because the older 2 arab men that appeared from the dark path had been sitting behind us the entire show. With their videos out and acting in strange matter that made her feel extremely uncomfortable with their pacing and their watching . They had watched our men walk away and sent the 3rd man into the crowd with us. It was so busy and noisy no one even noticed me screaming at this man, not one single person. And believe me i was SCREAMING at him trying to cause a scene. I called the police to report what happened because i have been a MESS since that night and i cannot get myself together mentally. The police and i went over the entire story and they confirmed it was 100% a kidnapping attempt, these men sell little girls into sex trafficking. I cannot explain how hard this is to even type for me but i hope it helps others. This IS REAL. This happened where i have been watching fire works for 24 years in \"small rochester\"\n\nThey go to big events so they go unnoticed\nThey target women without men and force them into situations where they are separated\nThey try to make a bond with your child to lure them willingly without a scene if possible.\nThey work in groups of 3 or more\nThey take your children and sell them into sex trafficking.\n\nNo i am not okay, and i wont be for a very long time. Had i not noticed what was going on- my baby girl would be gone forever. I cant stomach that one bit- i have been getting help and come home a giant mess every single day and have almost now called into work all week due to have anxiety. Every time i look at her i cry. It was bath night last night and i crawled in the bath with her and cried and she is very confused what is wrong with me. This post i hope is shared by many and taken very seriously.\n\nLOOK FOR THE SIGNS, DONT FEEL LIKE YOU ARE OVER REACTING.\nWATCH YOUR CHILDREN LIKE A HAWK and dont ever for a second let your guard down.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, July 2015","3574":"Opossums kill thousands of ticks each week, inhibiting the spread of Lyme Disease to humans.","12432":"\u201c@BBC\u2019s Syria producer @Dalatrm admits \u2018Assad sarine attack in #Douma was staged\u2019.

And by honoring Walkers request it saves the child from years of suffering.\n\nWe will see how this plays out.

It does no sound right. Could you find out. Thank you in advance.\n\nThis needs passing around far and wide and will affect anyone in the UK who doesn't have a biometric passport (also known as an e-passport) if flying to the USA.\n\nI was supposed to be on a flight this morning travelling to Florida for a holiday with my family booked through Thomson's, we saved long and hard for this holiday and filled in all the neccessary online forms including API and ESTA's only a couple of weeks ago only to turn up at the check in desk to be advised that I would not be allowed to travel as I did not have a biometric passport whilst the rest of our family had them, despite calls to the USA from the lady on check in they would not permit travel.\n\nThis is a change that came into force from USA Homeland Security on the 1st April 2016 which nobody including Thomson's seemed to be aware of until they were confronted with it on the day it came into force. Yet a month on Thomson's are still not advising people who have booked with them of the change and on calling their ''Customer Services'' if you can call it that they are just placing the onus back on the passenger citing ''it is the travellers responsibility to check everything is valid for travel''\n\nDo a Google search, it isn't mentioned on the Gov website, it isn't mentioned on Thomson's website either.\n\nMy passport was in date and had more than 6 months on it and I had filled out the ESTA's which were all approved.\n\nWe were then advised that if we still wished to travel on another date that we would have to pay an extra \u00a3150 each to transfer the booking. with no alternative I advised the rest of our party to go without me and I would try and see what I could do and look to meet up with them at the earliest available date which looks like being Wednesday next week from a different airport.\n\nI have now spent best part of 3 hours on the phone being passed from pillar to post and had to fork out over \u00a3500 to try and get to the US on Wednesday to meet up with a very distraught family to try and rescue a totally ruined holiday.\n\nHas anyone else suffered the same issue? What if any legal redress do we have?\n\nSo just to be clear, if you are travelling to the USA you won't be allowed to travel if you have a non biometric passport. The Biometric Passport has a camera logo on the front cover in the centre at the bottom of the page for those who may be unaware of the difference and were introduced gradually from 2006 onwards\n\nI am telling the world and his dog to raise awareness as it is clear that Thomson don't give two monkeys about customer care.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, May 2016","1625":"\u201cAs we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.

Honey is produced in most of the countries of the world.\n\nScientists of today also accept honey as a \"Ram Ban\" (very effective) medicine for all kinds of diseases.\n\nHoney can be used without any side effects for any kind of diseases. Today's science says that even though honey is sweet, if taken in the right dosage as a medicine, it does not harm diabetic patients. Weekly World News, a magazine in Canada, in its issue dated 17 January, 1995 has given the following list of diseases that can be cured by honey and cinnamon as researched by western scientists.\n\nHEART DISEASES: Make a paste of honey and cinnamon powder, apply on bread, chapatti, or other bread, instead of jelly and jam and eat it regularly for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol in the arteries and saves the patient from heart attack. Also those who already had an attack, if they do this process daily, are kept miles away from the next attack. Regular use of the above process relieves loss of breath and strengthens the heart beat. In America and Canada, various nursing homes have treated patients successfully and have found that as you age, the arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged; honey and cinnamon revitalizes the arteries and veins.\n\nBLADDER INFECTIONS: Take two tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. It destroys the germs in the bladder.\n\nTOOTHACHE: Make a paste of one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and five teaspoons of honey and apply on the aching tooth. This may be applied three times a day until the tooth stops aching.\n\nCHOLESTEROL: Two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of cinnamon powder mixed in 16 ounces of tea water, given to a cholesterol\npatient, was found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10% within 2 hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients, if taken 3 times a day, any chronic cholesterol is cured. As per information received in the said journal, pure honey taken with food daily relieves complaints of cholesterol.\n\nCOLDS: Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon lukewarm honey with 1\/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder daily for 3 days. This process will cure most chronic cough, cold and clear the sinuses.\n\nUPSET STOMACH: Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache and also clears stomach ulcers from the root.\n\nGAS: According to the studies done in India & Japan, it is revealed that if honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas.\n\nIMMUNE SYSTEM: Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacteria and viral attacks. Scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in large amounts.\n\nConstant use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles to fight bacteria and viral diseases.\n\nINDIGESTION: Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food, relieves acidity and digests the heaviest of meals.\n\nINFLUENZA: A scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural ingredient which kills the influenza germs and saves the patient from flu.\n\nLONGEVITY: Tea made with honey and cinnamon powder, when taken regularly, arrests the ravages of old age. Take 4 teaspoons of honey, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder and 3 cups of water and boil to make like tea. Drink 1\/4 cup, 3 to 4 times a day. It keeps the skin fresh and soft and arrests old age.\n\nPIMPLES: Mix three tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon to make a powder paste. Apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it next morning with warm water. If done daily for two weeks, it removes pimples from the root.\n\nSKIN INFECTIONS: Apply honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts on the affected parts to cure eczema, ringworm and all types of skin infections.\n\nWEIGHT LOSS: Daily in the morning 1\/2 hour before breakfast on an empty stomach and at night before sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in one cup water. If taken regularly, it reduces the weight of even the most obese person. Also, drinking this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie diet.\n\nCANCER: Recent research in Japan and Australia has revealed that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully. Patients suffering from these kinds of cancer should daily take one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon powder for one month 3 times a day.\n\nFATIGUE: Recent studies have shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather than being detrimental to the strength of the body. Senior citizens who take honey and cinnamon power in equal parts are more alert and flexible.\n\nDr. Milton who has done research says that a half tablespoon honey taken in a glass of water and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, taken daily after brushing your teeth and in the afternoon at about 3:00 p.m. When the vitality of the body starts to decrease, increases the vitality of the body within a week.\n\nBAD BREATH: People of South America first thing in the morning gargle with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water, so their breath stays fresh throughout the day.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Collected via e-mail, July 2006","3624":"\"Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started\"","7769":"While greeting North Korean dignitaries during his summit meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un, President Trump returned the military salute of a North Korean general.","10120":"An e-mail published by WikiLeaks revealed that three prominent Republicans were on Hillary Clinton's payroll.","7107":"Studies have proved that having an abortion increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.","4073":"\u201c\u2026the proportion of people who want friendship between Russia and Ukraine remained the same over the past 10 years.

They have even stated the name \"James Alefantis\" is similar to the french saying for \"I love children,\" they say that Comet Pizza's menu contains a pedophile symbol (it's a set of ping pong paddles?!?), they say there are obvious pedophilic references in instagram posts made by Alefantis of literal pizza memes. Am I the only person who thinks pizza is just pizza? It's like people who love bacon are obsessed with bacon. This guy owns a pizza place, the act of stuffing your face with pizza is like a trendy meme right now, he's the owner of a pizza place, why wouldn't he post pics of pizza?\n\nIt's pretty crazy, but getting traction in the past few days, as some of the \"suspects\" involved are posting responses to social media, obviously denying everything.\n\nWhat do you think? Have you heard of it? I'm sure there's some kind of international pedophile ring, but I don't know if these people are pointing fingers at the right people.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, November 2016","9961":"Jared Michelle sold his testicles to raise money in support of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.","13725":"President Obama encouraged schools to teach the Quran for extra credit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)","3575":"An electoral map based on Facebook analytics shows Donald Trump winning the 2016 presidential election in a \"clean sweep.\"","2146":"President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating funding for a program helping low-income families with their heating bills.","6314":"\"Malia Obama Fired From Cushy Internship At Spanish Embassy\"","15037":"\"The average age a child is trafficked into the commercial sex trade industry is between 11 and 14 years old.\"","10399":"Vaccines do not cause autism","13201":"Says \"80 percent of the tax breaks in\" President Donald Trump\u2019s tax-cut \"proposal go to the top 1 percent, that is, people making more than $730,000 a year.\"","14401":"On WikiLeaks emails: \"Our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party.\u201d","7545":"\"In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,\" but it\u2019s still only \"19 percent.\"","14307":"Continental Airlines CEO Gordon Bethune once personally threw a passenger off an airplane for being rude to a flight attendant.","10098":" \"Trump Signed His Latest Executive Order And It Will Effectively Eliminate Mass Amounts Of Democrat Voters.\" ","7860":" \u201cSince the recession ended, about 85 percent of income growth went to the top 1 percent.\u201d ","4496":"\"John McCain voted against funding the troops because of . . . a timeline in it to draw down American troops.\"","9199":"Says President Barack Obama \"is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore.\"","15130":"When ICE releases illegal immigrants, \"a lot of those people are not from Honduras and Mexico.

There is no treatment and no vaccine. It has jumped species, (by feeding greyhounds raw horse meat, which was infected with horse influenza), (horse influenza is avian flu, which jumped species from birds (avian flu), to horses (horse influenza). The avian flu has now moved to racing greyhounds and domestic dogs and the indications are that there may be a potential problem for humans. It is deadly and it is on the loose. It may just be a matter of time. The CDC is watching the disease.\n\nThere is no central tracking agency with report and stat capability for dogs that will get the word out to all vets in the US.\n\n\nThe domestic dog population is at present risk.\n\nThis week on my net groups I saw many anecdotal accounts of $100,000 show dogs dying while packed in ice and hooked up to IVs, with high temps. No one knows what is wrong with these dogs and the vets do not know what they are treating. I think it is Greyhound Influenza or Race Flu.\n\nShow populations are now infected and the majority of veterinarians have never heard of the disease. Isolated individuals know this but the country as a whole does not. A few days after exposure at dog shows, dogs are traveling back to their home states and infecting the local populations. Many dogs are dying needlessly. It is not kennel cough.\n\nThe period of incubation is 2-5 days. It is airborne, can be transmitted by inanimate objects, and clothing. Virtually all exposed will contract. The morbidity is 80% with 20% being sub clinically affected and shedding the virus. The course of the disease is four weeks. There are two forms, milder and very extreme. Two weeks into the viral disease the dog looks like he is getting over the cough and then bacterial infections become an acute problem. Oft times the owner has reported the dog is well, only to find that a short time later an acute bacterial infection has taken over the dog, in a matter of hours. The owners think the disease has run its course only to learn it hasn't gotten started yet, so dogs are dying needlessly.\n\nMy vet thinks earlier rather than later treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics are the best way to treat the disease. With proper vet care perhaps there will only be a mortality of 1-5%.\n\nThe information needs to go out so that all vets will know this is not kennel cough, so they will not VAX for kennel cough while ill, and so they can monitor beyond the two week period.\n\nIt has been almost impossible for me to understand how in the last four days i have contacted state vets who have never heard of the new influenza, all the while, the people with the info on the disease, refuse to release it nationally.\n\nThe AVMA has info that will go out next month. How many will die prior to that? I have begged and cajoled them to do this, so perhaps we are making some headway, however, we need info to go out ASAP.\n\nAPHIS says it is not their job.\n\nThe people who are handling research on the initial outbreak in FLA., are contacting local, (FLA) BUT not national sources to disseminate information.\n\nBelow is a link to a photo album in which i placed the FLA Veterinary Alert and Advisory, which was put out by the FLA VET MED ASSOC., at the request of the State Vet. It is not on the state website.\n\nhttp:\/\/photobucket.com\/albums\/y249\/citycolumbus\/\n\nIn my conversations with the researchers at the U. of FLA. I was told, by the lead researcher, who owns greyhounds, that they have no responsibility to provide this info to other states or to other vets. (BTW, Is some of the research funded by the gaming organizations?) (My state, GA., the state of FLA., and three highly placed individuals at Pfizer, told me to call the researcher.) The researcher said to me that cultures do not need to be done on potential affecteds, and she denied that the illness is from horses, though she is quoted in articles as applauding the Cornell researcher who identified it as horse influenza. The FLA state vet said: \"We know it came from horses.\"\n\nThe researcher is working to do a contracted vaccine with \" a company.\" She is working on a paper. She did not want to discuss the influenza though her name, email and number appears as the contact source on the state of FLA Veterinary Alert and Advisory that went out to all FLA vets. I was told by some at Pfizer that Pfizer is not the company who is helping her develop the vaccine.\n\nThe researcher said the FLA VETERINARY ALERT AND ADVISORY should not be put on the net. However the FLA state Vet, Dr. Thomas Holt, told me, on Fri., Sept 16, 2005 to put it on the net...\"Feel free to use it.\"\n\nMany state vets who do not know anything at all about this illness even though the state of FLA. put out memos on the influenza in August 05 in the state of FLA., without notifying other states.\n\nIf the researchers are correct there will be a national epidemic. When a disease is in a mobile population an epidemic is possible. Large groupings of dogs, such as shows, kennels, rescues, etc., are at risk.\n\nMost vets across the country have never heard of the disease. A treatment protocol has not been developed. They are treating it as if it is kennel cough. All vets need to be informed about it ASAP! Many of us concerned dog people would like to see state statistics compiled on the illness and the eventual treatment outcomes.\n\nFolks, this is one of the many new problems we are seeing from feeding raw meat to dogs. Please do not do it.\n\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Collected on the Internet, 2005","3982":"A video shows an extreme thrill ride found at an amusement park.","3129":"The Trump Administration\u2019s policies have halted a research effort seeking a cure for HIV.","4523":"iPhone users can access emergency services simply by tapping the Lock button of their device five times.","8221":"Sharia law has been established in a jurisdiction in Texas.","4488":"\"Hospitals are closing in rural America because they don't have access to high-speed internet.\"","9112":"\"Fifty percent of the graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done illegal drugs.\"","1577":"Someone who has taken LSD more than seven times is automatically deemed legally insane.","13996":"In 2010, 2,694 young people were killed by gunfire. 1,773 were victims of homicide; 67 were elementary school-age children.","847":"\u201cThe ads attacking Jeff Denham?

It's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and when to eat.\n\nWhat is the correct way of eating fruits?\n\nIT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS! * FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.\n\nIf you eat fruit like that, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities.\n\nFRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD.\n\nLet's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit. The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so.\n\nIn the meantime the whole meal rots and ferments and turns to acid. The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.\n\nSo please eat your fruits on an empty stomach or before your meals! You have heard people complaining - every time I eat water-melon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet etc - actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on an empty stomach. The fruit mixes with the putrefying other food and\nproduces gas and hence you will bloat!\n\nGraying hair, balding, nervous outburst, and dark circles under the eyes all these will not happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.\n\nThere is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter. If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the Secret of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.\n\nWhen you need to drink fruit juice - drink only fresh fruit juice, NOT from the cans. Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. You only get to taste. Cooking destroys all the vitamins.\n\nBut eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice. If you should drink the juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it.\n\nYou can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse your body. Just eat fruits and drink fruit juice throughout the 3 days and you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look!\n\nKIWI: Tiny but mighty. This is a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin E & fiber. Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange.\n\nAPPLE: An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Although an apple has a low vitamin C content, it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby helping to lower the risks of colon cancer, heart attack & stroke.\n\nSTRAWBERRY: Protective Fruit. Strawberries have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect the body from cancer-causing, blood vessel-clogging free radicals.\n\nORANGE: Sweetest medicine. Taking 2-4 oranges a day may help keep colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessens the risk of colon cancer.\n\nWATERMELON: Coolest thirst quencher. Composed of 92% water, it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione, which helps boost our immune system. They are also a key source of lycopene - the cancer fighting oxidant. Other nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium.\n\nGUAVA & PAPAYA: Top awards for vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high vitamin C content. Guava is also rich in fiber, which helps prevent constipation. Papaya is rich in carotene; this is good for your\neyes.\n\nVariations: \u00a0 Versions in circulation in 2010 were titled \"Dr. Oz on Eating Fruit.\" There's no good reason to associate the television health pundit's name with the Internet-circulated piece, because Dr. Oz is not the author of the item, nor has he endorsed its claims about ingesting fruit only at specific times.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, March 2009","660":"CIA Deputy Director Gina Haspel has a warrant for her arrest in Germany.","9990":"You can now order pizza from pizza vending machines.","11452":"\"First, Donald Trump said wages are too high, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.\"","12312":"Trump supports \"an agenda\" to privatize the VA","5700":"\"We've won twice as many states.

The nurse just kinda slipped it in along with all the other regular questions. I told her I refused to answer because it was against the law to ask. Everyone, whether you have guns or not, should give a neutral answer so they have no idea who does and who doesn't.\n\nMy doctor asked me if I had guns in my house and also if any were loaded. I , of course, answered yes to both questions. Then he asked why I kept a loaded gun close to my bed. I answered that my son, who is a certified gun instructor and also works for Homeland Security, advised me that an unloaded, locked up gun is no protection against criminal attack. The Government now requires these questions be asked of people on Medicare, and probably everyone else.\n\nJust passing this along for your information: I had to visit a doctor other than my regular doctor when my doctor was on vacation. One of the questions on the form I had to fill out was: Do you have any guns in your house?? My answer was None of your damn business!! So it is out there!\n\nIt is either an insurance issue or government intervention. Either way, it is out there and the second the government gets into your medical records (As they want to under Obamacare) it will become a major issue and will ultimately result in lock and load!!\n\nPlease pass this on to all the other retired guys and gun owners...Thanks.\n\n\n\nFrom a Vietnam Vet and retired Police Officer:\n\nI had a doctors appointment at the local VA clinic yesterday and found out something very interesting that I would like to pass along.\n\nWhile going through triage before seeing the doctor, I was asked at the end of the exam, three questions:\n\n1. Did I feel stressed? \n2. Did I feel threatened?  \n3. Did I feel like doing harm to someone?\n\nThe nurse then informed me, that if I had answered yes to any of the questions, I would have lost my concealed carry permit as it would have gone into my medical records and the VA would have reported it to Homeland Security.\n\nLooks like they are going after the vets first. Other gun people like retired law enforcement will probably be next. Then when they go after the civilians, what argument will they have?\n\nBe forewarned and be aware. The Obama administration has gone on record as considering veterans and gun owners potential terrorists. Whether you are a gun owner veteran or not, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !\n\nIf you know veterans and gun owners, please pass this on to them.

It happened in the Philippines about 1911, when Gen. John J. Pershing was in command of the garrison. There had been numerous Islamic terrorist attacks, so \"Black Jack\" told his boys to catch the perps and teach them a lesson.\n\nForced to dig their own graves, the terrorists were all tied to posts, execution style. The US soldiers then brought in pigs and slaughtered them, rubbing their bullets in the blood and fat. Thus, the terrorists were terrorized; they saw that they would be contaminated with hogs' blood. This would mean that they could not enter Heaven, even if they died as terrorist martyrs.\n\nAll but one was shot, their bodies dumped into the grave, and the hog guts dumped atop the bodies. The lone survivor was allowed to escape back to the terrorist camp and tell his brethren what happened to the others. This brought a stop to terrorism in the Philippines for the next 50 years.\n\nPointing a gun into the face of Islamic terrorists won't make them flinch. They welcome the chance to die for Allah. Like Gen. Pershing, we must show them that they won't get to Muslim heaven (which they believe has an endless supply of virgins) but instead will die with the hated pigs of the\ndevil.\n\n\n\nSubject: How to end the war quickly if you have absolutely no respect for pigs!\n\nAn Israeli friend recently informed me that the UK fought the Islamic terrorist attacks by burying the criminals with a pig. Apparently the Islamic belief is that if ones' body is buried with a pig (because they are considered unclean) their soul will go to hell. I did a little research into this subject matter and found it to be true. This got me thinking.\n\nIf we put a baby pig on every airline flight then all suicide terrorists would abort their missions as they would not want their souls to go to hell. Additionally, if we drop shipped, oh say, 100,000 pigs into Afghanistan I think our recon and assault efforts may be more successful. Apparently Muslims dislike the very sight of pigs A LOT!\n\nThey are also adamantly opposed to alcohol, thus we spike their water supply with a few thousand gallons of moonshine, get them drunk and turn the pigs loose.

As I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone, I offer a few corrections.\n\nBill says: \"In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.\" \n\nThe facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids.\" \n\nThe facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.\" \n\nThe facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam; yes, flunked. It is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas \u2014 none \u2014 and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas\nGovernor.\n\nBill says: \"President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its chairman.\" \n\nThe facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.\n\nBill says: \"She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital.\" \n\nThe facts are: Yes, she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Walmart board of directors for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994, but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.\"\n\nThe facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary was the face of America all over the world.\"\n\nThe facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.\n\nBill says: \"Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children's and women's issues.\"\n\nThe facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize the Woodstock fiasco of 40 years ago.\n\nHere is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton:\n\nShe has done everything possible to weaken the President and our country\n(that's you and me!) when it comes to the war on terror.\n\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.\n\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to\/from the USA.\n\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.\n\n4.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.\n\n5.\u00a0 \u00a0She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.\n\nOne cannot think of a single bill Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our country in the War on Terror. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our country and make it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.\n\nShare this with every democrat you know. Ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it \u2014 Dick Morris has said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for defamation of character! And you better believe Hillary would sue him.\n\nIs America ready for a woman president?\n\nI believe we are, just NOT THIS one.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, January 2016","3244":"\u201cYou look at our air and our water and it\u2019s right now at a record clean.\u201d","2218":"\"Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education.\"","6391":"Nigerian opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar gave out packs of food and money at a rally in Sokoto","4407":"\"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected.\"","11507":"Georgia state troopers blocked off entrance to their state days before Hurricane Florence made landfall.","64":"Says \"51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax.\"","7733":"Pink Cross Publishing is about to publish a gay revision of the Bible.","11055":"Says actor Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson wore a T-shirt stating: \"We Stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen.\"","5558":"Federal government employees can be fired after 30 or more days of government shutdown.","5033":"Says Fort Hood near Killeen, Texas, is \"the largest military installation in the free world.\"","3980":"\"If you give guns to gangs, you can get out of jail free, if (California\u2019s Proposition 57) passes.

Bill of Rights for Children and Youth in California.\nExisting law provides for the care and welfare of children and youth in various contexts, including, but not limited to, child welfare services, foster care, health care, nutrition, homeless assistance, and education.\nAssembly Concurrent Resolution No. 80 (Res. Ch. 101, Stats. 2009) declares the Legislature\u2019s support of a Bill of Rights for the Children and Youth of California that resolves to invest in all children and youth in order to achieve specified goals to create an optimal environment for their healthy development.\nThis bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to expand and codify the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California, outlines the research-based essential needs of California\u2019s children, and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed.\nThe bill would declare the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact legislation for the purpose of ensuring that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.\n\nBILL TEXT\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\nSECTION 1.\n\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares that all children and youth, regardless of gender, class, race, ethnicity, national origin, culture, religion, immigration status, sexual orientation, or ability, have inherent rights that entitle them to protection, special care, and assistance, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) The right to parents, guardians, or caregivers who act in their best interest.\n(2) The right to form healthy attachments with adults responsible for their care and well-being.\n(3) The right to live in a safe and healthy environment.\n(4) The right to social and emotional well-being.\n(5) The right to opportunities to attain optimal cognitive, physical, and social development.\n(6) The right to appropriate, quality education and life skills leading to self-sufficiency in adulthood.\n(7) The right to appropriate, quality health care.\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to expand and codify the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California created by Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 80 (Res. Ch. 101, Stats. 2009), to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California, outlines the research-based essential needs of California\u2019s children, and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed.\n\nSEC. 2.\n\nIt is the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact appropriate legislation to accomplish all of the following:\n\n(a) Develop and put forth research-based policy solutions that will ensure the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.\n(b) Determine the amount of revenue and resources necessary to ensure that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.\n(c) Identify and obtain the revenue and resources necessary to ensure that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.\n\nMany across the state are already calling this the \u201cThe Destruction of Family Act, or The Medical Kidnap Act, or The Government Owns Your Children Act.\u201d\nThe website, Age of Autism, asks, \u201cWhy would a state, in the United States of America, have to enact legislation to ensure what the Constitution already protects \u2013 life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?\u201d\nRead this closely again. Who decides what \u201cacting in a child\u2019s best interest\u201d means? Or what is \u201cappropriate\u201d healthcare?\nThis is very frightening and downright scary news to any parent in the state of California. Imagine for a minute that someone shows up at your door and physically takes your children out of your home? And for what reason? They didn\u2019t go to the dentist? They didn\u2019t get their latest flu shot? Perhaps you homeschool your child and the state doesn\u2019t think you are doing a good job.\nMany parents across social media are already calling this the \u2018most destructive\u2019 family based bill to ever hit the floor of the California senate. Some parents are even calling for immediate removal of Senator Pan from his senate seat.\nOne parent comments, \u201cThe lines of the California state senate and the endorsement deals that Senator Pan has made with various pharmaceutical companies are completely blurred. \u201c\n\nOne could say that this senator has been \u2018bought\u2019 and is nothing more than a \u2018whipping boy\u2019 for whatever drug company that decides to write him a check to endorse their latest products.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this may actually be the truth. According to Health Impact News,\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies and their trade groups gave more than $2 million to current members of the Legislature in 2013-2014, about 2 percent of the total raised, records show. Nine of the top 20 recipients are either legislative leaders or serve on either the Assembly or Senate health committees. Receiving more than $95,000, the top recipient of industry campaign cash is Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento Democrat and doctor who is carrying the vaccine bill.\n\nIn addition, the industry donated more than $500,000 to outside campaign spending groups that helped elect some current members last year.\n\nPharmaceutical companies also spent nearly $3 million more during the 2013-2014 legislative session lobbying the Legislature, the governor, the state pharmacists\u2019 board and other agencies, according to state filings.

That this bill would in essence be an infringement on your rights as a parent to your child?\n\nAnswer in the comments below\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, December 2016","15024":" Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock \"was an antifa member.\" ","6655":" Claimed foreign-born residents in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u201ccould be 40 years old, 41 years old.\u201d ","4302":"\u201cHillary Clinton attacked those same women, attacked them viciously.\"","13703":"A meme accurately compares the treatment of foreign children by Germany in 1944 and the U.S. in 2018.","9893":"China is \"in the South China Sea and (building)\u00a0a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen.\"","4588":"\"All of Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas Cowboys football stadium consumes at peak times.\"","7082":"Ted Cruz is in negotiations to be Donald Trump\u2019s running mate.","3814":"\"I don\u2019t take a dime of PAC money.\"","9542":"In October 2017, a \"demonic\" drag queen read a \"sexually explicit\" book to children at a Long Beach public library named after Michelle Obama.","8359":"Actor\/comedia Eddie Murphy died in a car crash in 2018.","1678":"Health care is the \"No. 1 reason for bankruptcy.\"","4412":"'Time' ran a cover story titled \"How to Survive the Coming Ice Age\" in 1977.","13620":"\"...in 1612 the word Ukraine was not heard anywhere.\u201d","1813":" \"GM Korea company announced today that it will cease production and close its Gunsan plant in May of 2018, and they\u2019re going to move back to Detroit.\" ","8785":"The Keystone oil pipeline \"would employ 20,000 people in the United States.\"","4822":"In 2018, provisional estimates show the economy grew by 6.1%.","10851":"Says Donald Trump \"has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system.\"","13011":"\u201cKhodorkovsky's puppets [Novaya Gazeta] are fulfilling an order from the West, trying to sabotage Russia's defense industry.
