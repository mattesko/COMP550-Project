Cecil Rhodes died over a century ago. Autres temps, autres moeurs. If you don\u2019t understand what this means \u2013 and it would not remotely surprise us if that were the case \u2013 then we really think you should ask yourself the question: \u201cWhy am I at Oxford?\u201d\n\nOxford, let us remind you, is the world\u2019s second oldest extant university. Scholars have been studying here since at least the 11th century. We\u2019ve played a major part in the invention of Western civilisation, from the 12th century intellectual renaissance through the Enlightenment and beyond. Our alumni include William of Ockham, Roger Bacon, William Tyndale, John Donne, Sir Walter Raleigh, Erasmus, Sir Christopher Wren, William Penn, Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), Samuel Johnson, Robert Hooke, William Morris, Oscar Wilde, Emily Davison, Cardinal Newman, Julie Cocks. We\u2019re a big deal. And most of the people privileged to come and study here are conscious of what a big deal we are. Oxford is their alma mater \u2013 their dear mother \u2013 and they respect and revere her accordingly.\n\nAnd what were your ancestors doing in that period? Living in mud huts, mainly. Sure we\u2019ll concede you the short lived Southern African civilisation of Great Zimbabwe. But let\u2019s be brutally honest here. The contribution of the Bantu tribes to modern civilisation has been as near as damn it to zilch.\n\n[...]\nhttp:\/\/www.dailygripe.org\/?p=358\n\n\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, April 2016","6619":"Says Alex Sink supported \"more taxes on water and TV.\"","7291":"Meth in Louisiana is contaminated with the Zika virus.","15338":"President Obama promoted former Taliban captive Bowe Bergdahl to staff sergeant.","7103":"\"Thomas Paine wrote that \u2018the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government.\u2019\"","12954":"The U.S. has a global trade deficit of $800 billion.","6660":"\"The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions.

He walked around his soon to be church for 30 minutes while it was filling with people for service....only 3 people out of the 7-10,000 people said hello to him. He asked people for change to buy food... NO ONE in the church gave him change. He went into the sanctuary to sit down in the front of the church and was asked by the ushers if he would please sit in the back. He greeted people to be greeted back with stares and dirty looks, with people looking down on him and judging him.\n\nAs he sat in the back of the church, he listened to the church announcements and such. When all that was done, the elders went up and were excited to introduce the new pastor of the church to the congregation....\"We would like to introduce to you Pastor Jeremiah Steepek\"... The congregation looked around clapping with joy and anticipation.....The homeless man sitting in the back stood up... and started walking down the aisle... the clapping stopped with ALL eyes on him.... he walked up the altar and took the microphone from the elders (who were in on this) and paused for a moment.... then he recited\n\n\"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'\n\n\"The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'\"\n\nAfter he recited this, he looked towards the congregation and told them all what he had experienced that morning... many began to cry and many heads were bowed in shame... he then said... Today I see a gathering of people... not a church of Jesus Christ. The world has enough people, but not enough disciples... when will YOU decide to become disciples? He then dismissed service until next week... Being a Christian is more than something you claim. It's something you live by and share with others.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, July 2013","15536":"Californians pay \"the highest electricity bills\" in the nation.","15417":"\"Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers.\"","10272":" \"Since NAFTA\u2019s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion, and it\u2019s a much higher number than that.\" ","5569":" Claimed that former President Obama once said, \u201cPresident Trump would need a magic wand to get to 4% GDP.\u201d ","1806":"\"Two weeks ago, a man entered the world\u2019s busiest airport in Atlanta, Georgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended-capacity, 100-round magazine.\"","10197":"\u201cToday, unfortunately, it can be noted that the United States is trying to establish a loyal regime [in Afghanistan] under the pretext of fighting terrorism.

During the training session there was a presentation by three speakers who represented the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths who explained their belief systems. I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say.\n\nThe Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam complete with a video. After the presentations time was provided for questions and answers. When it was my turn I directed my question to the Imam and asked: \"Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that all of the Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world. And, that by killing an infidel, which is a command to all Muslims, they are assured of a place in heaven. If that's the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?\"\n\nThere was no disagreement with my statements and without hesitation he replied, \"Non-believers!\"\n\nI responded, \"So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can go to heaven. Is that correct?\"\n\nThe expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He sheepishly replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nI then said, \"Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Pat Robertson or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to heaven.\"\n\nThe Imam was speechless.\n\nI continued, \"I also have problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me. Let me ask you a question . . . would you rather have your Allah who tell[s] you to kill me in order to go to heaven or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am going to heaven and wants you to be with me?\"\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame.\n\nChuck Colson once told me something that has sustained me these 20 years of prison ministry.

Released today, the transcript indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the school. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama's detractors have been seeking.\n\nThe news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama's legitimacy and qualification to serve as president. When reached for comment in London, where he has been in meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Obama smiled but refused comment on the issue. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs scoffed at the report stating that this was obviously another attempt by a right-wing conservative group to discredit the president and undermine the administrations efforts to move the country in a new direction.\n\nBritain's Daily Mail has also carried the story in a front-page article titled, Obama Eligibility Questioned, leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama's first official visit to the U.K.\n\nIn a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama's legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey. This lawsuit claims Obama's dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president. Donofrios case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama's citizenship or qualification to serve as president.\n\nGary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama's campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, April 2009","312":"Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly was found dead on Long Island.","1468":"A photograph shows a bag of Skittles signed by George Zimmerman.","14683":"Parkland school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz has a \"connection\" to former president Barack Obama and his administration.","6072":"Portugal has declared Pakistan safe for travel","7970":" \"GOP congressional candidate\" admits \"to being a pedophile.\" ","6739":"Photo of Philippine clergy calling for death penalty to be restored","4396":"The CIA found a \"dead man's switch\" on the computer of the deceased father of a doctor treating Hillary Clinton for dementia.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nClinton\u2019s Dr. Daniel Fleck, was found dead near his home just 24 hours after releasing Hillary\u2019s most secret medical records to the public.\n\u2014 J.C.

If it ends in a 4, it's the lowest it will be. \n\nTarget's mark down schedule: \n\nMONDAY: Kids' Clothing, Stationery (office supplies, gift wrap), Electronics.   \nTUESDAY: Women's Clothing and Domestics. \nWEDNESDAY: Men's Clothing, Toys, Health and Beauty.\nTHURSDAY: Lingerie, Shoes, Housewares. \nFRIDAY: cosmetics. \n\n\n\nIf you're like me, you probably love shopping at Costco, hoping to find a great deal on everything from TV's to bulk diapers.  But shopping at the big box megastore can be a bit overwhelming.  Did you know there is actually a \"Costco Price Tag Code\" that can let you know if you're getting the best deals?\n\nThe key to the code is not the dollars but the cents.  Those last two digits of the price tell you everything.  A price ending in .99 is much different than one ending in .97 or .49.  Check it out ...\n\nPrice ending in .99 \u2013 the product is full price\n\nAny time you see the price ending in .99 you know that item is full-priced and has not been marked down. It still may be a good deal though, this is Costco after all.\n\nPrice ending in .97 \u2013 a deal decided by the manager\n\nA price that ends in .97 is what we are looking for. Usually this is a special price you're not going to find again. Once it's gone it's gone. These can be some great deals.\n\nPrice ending in .49 or .79 \u2013 manufacturer's special\n\nA price ending in .49 or .79 is a manufacturer's special. This is a product the manufacturer is testing out at Costco, usually at a lower price than Costco would sell the item at.\n\nPrice ending in .00 \u2014 the goods are about to go!\n\nA price ending in .00 is probably the best deal you will find in the store. It means the manager wants the item out. And once it's out, the product is gone for good.\n\nA price tag with an asterisk \u2014 it's discounted and done\n\nBe on the lookout for price tags with an asterisk. This means the product is discontinued. A combination of a .97 and an asterisk means you are getting a last chance good deal.\n\nWe all know Costco has the lowest prices in town but now you can use these tricks to get deeper discounts inside the warehouse.
